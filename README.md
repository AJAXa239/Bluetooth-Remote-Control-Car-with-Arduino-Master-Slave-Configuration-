# Bluetooth-Remote-Control-Car-with-Arduino-Master-Slave-Configuration-
This project showcases a Bluetooth remote-controlled car where the car acts as the slave device and the remote controller serves as the master Arduino. The system is built using Arduino microcontrollers, making it an excellent project for learning about wireless communication, motor control, and embedded systems.
